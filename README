   - `REMOTE_PORT = 5000`  
   - `LOCAL_PORT = 5000`  
3. Run the following command to install the service:

## File Transfer Details
- Files added by external programs to `C:/sample` are automatically transferred to the other machine.
- Files transferred from one machine to the other will not be re-sent, preventing infinite loops.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Check the Windows Event Viewer for service logs under **Application Logs**.
- Ensure firewall rules allow traffic on port 5000 (or your chosen port).
- Confirm both machines have the correct `REMOTE_IP` settings.
